 <h1>Beth Israel Hospital is Shutting Down....What Does This Mean For the Future of Hospitals </h1>
   

<dateline> October 10, 2023<dateline/>

<p>The lower Manhattan community has actively been protesting the closure of hospitals in their region. Back in 2008, The Cabrini Medical center that was located at 227 E 19th St. New York, NY 10003 had closed down due to financial difficulties.Then just two years later St Vincent’s Hospital closed after battling financial hardships for years. This left residents relying solely on Beth Israel. However in 2020 Mount Sinai had proposed the idea of closing their Beth Israel location, but eventually ditched those plans after the pandemic. A brief relief, but now they are being told that it will be closing after all and will leave many locals forced to redirect. More than that it will affect local residents that heavily rely on their medicaid services, increase ambulance times and costs, as well as impact patient services.

<p>Mount Sinai Beth Israel Hospital is the last level one trauma center in lower Manhattan. A level I trauma center means a facility that is capable of providing the full range of services required of trauma patients, conducts trauma research, and provides training to surgical residents. This means that the closing of this hospital will likely result in longer ambulance rides to farther hospitals. Alternatively their only options would be expensive private hospitals. The next available emergency room with a level one trauma center is Bellevue Hospital Center at 462 First Avenue, New York, NY 10016, approximately a ten minute drive from Beth Israel currently. However, this does not account for traffic congestion in Manhattan overall. This would result in an influx of patients, increased wait times and  force many to redirect to other facilities for regular or emergency needs. </p>
<p> According to a Mount Sinai Beth Israel statement: “Despite massive investments and upgrades, in the past ten years MSBI has sustained losses in excess of $1B. Mount Sinai Health System has done everything in its power to support MSBI. Nevertheless, losses have escalated and MSBI is on track to lose an additional $150M this year. Maintaining the status quo is no longer an option.”  According to Moody’s investors at the end of fiscal 2022 the hospital had acquired $1.6 billion in debt. Mount Sinai’s spokespeople have spoken out saying that in order to preserve their ability to continue providing healthcare services they must make this hard decision for the greater good of Mount Sinai overall. Financial costs from significant increases in labor, supply costs, and the years of decreasing patients has led to significant loss. In January of 2023 about 7,000 nurses from the Mount Sinai Health systems and Montefiore Health system went on a 10-day strike demanding a better deal in staffing coverage and better wages. These events along with other financial factors have persuaded MSBI directors to make the decision to close Mount Sinai Beth Israel. According to MSBI spokespeople “The simple fact is the MSBI is running at approximately 20% capacity and losing $150M annually.” A statistic that is bound to drag down the rest of the Mount Sinai organization. </p>
<p> Many of Beth Israel’s admittees are on medicaid. This means that this affordable healthcare option will be taken from them and will impact them significantly. They will have to find another location that is able to take their insurance and cover their necessary health services. According to the inpatient utilization statistics of the 2022 fiscal, released by the American Hospital directory, there were about 5,578 medicare inpatients in the cardiology, cardiovascular surgery, medicine, neurology, neurosurgery, oncology, orthopedic surgery, orthopedics, psychiatry, pulmonology, surgery, surgery for malignancy, urology and vascular surgery department combined. That is over 5,000 patients that will be forced to scatter and search for a new location. According to the American Hospital directory the top three zip codes that Mount Sinai Beth Israel's inpatient services cover are the 11234 (Mill Basin, BK), 10009 (East Village), 10002(Lower East Side). The hospital’s closing will greatly impact their services directly and cause major inconveniences.</p>
